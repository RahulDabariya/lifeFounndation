                                Last month, fund raising initiatives were taken up and drives were launched to attract donations for the education of the underprivileged children. Many people participated in the event and donated their heart out.

                                We have been raising funds with great difficulty for the work that this charity does in Africa. We work in rural communities in Eastern Nigeria and other parts and provide funding for widows to build businesses in order for them to help themselves and stimulate the local economy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We work with young women to train and develop their expertise in sewing and tailoring so they can start their own business and contribute to the community. This ensures that they avoid joining the cohort of ladies in the oldest industry known to man- the â€œnight trade.

                                The year 2014 was a very exciting year for us and the first half of 2015 is proving to be the same. We have taken steps through the first half of this year to expand our influence throughout the United States and the Continent of Africa. Two more storage units have been rented and supplies are already coming in as we prepare to ship another container.
